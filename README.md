This tool uses Eigen for matrix calculation. So first we need to install Eigen3.

$ sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev

But we should do extra: 
$ cd /usr/include/eigen3
we can see these: Eigen  signature_of_eigen3_matrix_library  unsupported
$ sudo cp Eigen ../ -R
so that g++ can find Eigen


How to compile the source code，static build linking libyaml-cpp.a: 
$ g++ main.cpp -L. -lyaml-cpp -o main

How to use the tool?
excute the binary by giving three params:
1. parent yaml file
2. child yaml file 
3. file you want to name and the output is in this file

Math：
Suppose we have six LiDARs same setup with new vclass. The front high LiDAR wants to know what is the coordinates seen by right rear. The two lidars don't have co-visibility.
We use the front right to be a bridge. 

$$
T_{rr}^{rf}P_{rr} = P_{rf}
T_{rf}^{fh}P_{rf} = P_{fh}
=>
T_{rf}^{fh}T_{rr}^{rf}P_{rr}=P_{fh}
$$

So transform from right rear to front high is : $T_{rf}^{fh}T_{rr}$
T_{rf}^{fh} stands for the hesai40p_right_front_extrinsics.yaml, T_{rr}^{rf} stands for the hesai40p_right_rear_right_front_extrinsics.yaml which is generated by the calibration tool in apollo platform.

So this tool can generate the hesai40p_right_rear_extrinsics.yaml for apollo which will be used by localization module and Hesai LiDAR driver module.
